       "   'abstract': 'One of the most robust findings in health psychology is that poor quality relationships place people at risk for an array of disease outcomes, including inflammation, depression, and premature mortality. Thus, identifying scalable interventions that improve relationship quality, thereby improving disease outcomes, is an essential public health goal. Mindfulness interventions, which encourage attention towards and acceptance of current experiences, are a promising target for improving relationship quality. For example, people who are higher in trait mindfulness also self-report having higher romantic relationship quality. In addition, a mindfulness intervention improved self-reported romantic relationship quality relative to a non-active wait-list control. The wait-list comparison condition from prior work makes it unclear whether the mindfulness intervention itself or non-specific intervention factors (e.g., positive treatment expectancies) were driving positive relationship outcomes, a significant limitation. Thus, a critical next step is to compare a mindfulness intervention to an active control comparison condition. The overarching aim of this proposal is to experimentally test whether a mindfulness intervention improves relationship quality, assessed via both subjective and objective measures, relative to an active control comparison. We focus specifically on mindfulness and romantic relationship quality in this exploratory R21 because this focus builds on a well-established link between romantic relationships and disease outcomes. Romantic couples from the community will be randomly assigned to one of two arms: mindfulness vs. active control. Both interventions will be completed on a smart-phone for 14 days using identical intervention activities as our existing published research. Before and after the 14-day period, couples will attend a lab visit and provide subjective and objective relationship quality data. Before and after the intervention, participants will also provide secondary health data: sleep quality, self-rated health, depressive symptoms, personal well-being, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure. Although multiple high impact theoretical papers have underscored the need to examine the effect of a mindfulness intervention on relationship quality, empirical work is sparse. This lack of research is surprising given that poor quality relationships robustly increase risk for morbidity and accelerated mortality. This study is the first step towards testing a mindfulness intervention as a means to improving relationship quality. If the aims of this R21 are achieved, the research team will use these data to propose a larger study about mindfulness, relationships, and disease outcomes. The long-term goal of this research program is to understand whether a mindfulness intervention enhances relationship quality, thereby improving disease outcomes. If this goal is achieved, the research team will have identified a scalable intervention for enriching the quality of people’s relationships, with the downstream consequence of also improving their health. In doing so, these data would identify improved relationship quality as a novel mechanism through which mindfulness alters disease outcomes.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Project Summary:Over the last 30 years, spine pain has been the most common reason for Medicare enrollment based on disability, and Medicare enrollees – whether enrolled by virtue of disability or age – have increasingly used spinal manipulation therapy to treat such pain. The American Heart and American Stroke Associations (AHA/ASA) recommended that patients be informed of the statistical association between cervical spinal manipulation (CSM) and cervical artery dissection (CAD) but could not articulate the magnitude of that risk. The literature on which the AHA/ASA based their recommendations used older data from outside the US and flawed methods (inaccurate identification of the primary outcome of interest (CAD), reliance on patient recall to identify CSM, using controls that were considerably healthier than cases, and limiting CSM to that provided by doctors of chiropractic, although other practitioner types also provide CSM).To inform Medicare enrollees, providers, and policymakers about the risk of CAD following CSM, we will analyze Medicare services data from 2004-2015 for beneficiaries concurrently enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B. To address the limitations of prior studies, we will use diagnostic codes specific to CAD to accurately identify cases, match cases to proper controls, identify common comorbidities of CAD, assess outcomes (including mortality and changes in costs of care), and use sophisticated statistical methods to determine whether there is an association between CSM and CAD, by provider type. If we find such a relationship, we will calculate the risk of CAD following a visit for CSM.To avoid the selection bias that occurred in prior studies, we will use propensity scoring both to adjust for the likelihood of obtaining CSM (studies have shown that patients who use CSM are younger, healthier, and wealthier than those who do not) and to match controls on comorbidities found to be associated with CAD. Those adjustments – in concert with an instrumental variable approach – should unmask relationships that might have gone undetected in previous studies due to a combination of exposure, selection, and recall bias.Our pilot work indicates that there will be well over 9,000 cases of CAD in the Medicare population during the time period of our analysis, dwarfing the size of all previous studies of CAD. Policymakers, providers, and patients will be able to use our findings about the risks of CSM compared to other commonly used treatments for spine pain to make informed financing and treatment decisions.\\xa0',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Project Summary/AbstractNew Hampshire has second the highest per capita rate of opioid use disorders (OUD) and the highest rateof fentanyl overdose in the U.S. An estimated 10% of deliveries are affected by perinatal OUD, and NewHampshire can anticipate as many as 1,000 infants born with prenatal opioid exposure each year. Roughly40% of recent opioid overdose deaths in NH were women, and 21% of pregnancy-associated deathsbetween 2013-2015 were attributed to overdose. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,American Academy of Pediatrics, and American Society for Addiction Medicine call for adoption of caremodels that promote early identification and treatment for pregnant and parenting women with OUD.Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is the recommended best practice for pregnant women with OUD.Even when MAT is initiated, rates of treatment discontinuation and relapse are high, particularly in the earlypostpartum period. Barriers to retention include high rates of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stressdisorder, and adverse social conditions (e.g., housing and economic insecurity, interpersonal relationshipviolence). Pain management is also complicated for pregnant women with OUD, and under-management ofpain is a strong risk factor for relapse. Contemplative, such as yoga and mindfulness, may reduce risks forrelapse for pregnant and parenting women with OUD. Building capacity for providing MAT and collaborativecare to pregnant and parenting women with OUD in obstetric settings is a priority of the New HampshireState Targeted Response (STR) to the Opioid Crisis. This project represents a partnership with NHstakeholders to augment this STR initiative through development and pilot evaluation of a trauma-informedyoga and mindfulness relapse prevention intervention (Mindful Moms in Recovery: MMORE). The R21phase has three specific aims: 1) Identify needs and areas of adaptation of trauma-informed yoga andmindfulness-based relapse prevention protocols through formative work with pregnant and parentingwoman, 2) Develop an integrated10-session intervention protocol with iterative feedback from clientstakeholders, and 3) Evaluate feasibility, acceptability and efficacy trends of MMORE in a pre-post pilot withpregnant women. Demonstrated milestones will provide the foundation for the R33, with three specific aims:1) Evaluate MMORE in a small randomized controlled study with pregnant women as an augment tocollaborative MAT care in obstetric practices for impact on MAT treatment retention, relapse, and riskindicators (depression, anxiety, stress, pain management), 2) Examine mechanisms of treatment effects onoutcomes assessed longitudinally into postpartum, 3) Evaluate barriers and facilitators to translation andsustainable implementation of MMORE for women receiving MAT as part of obstetric care. If successful,MMORE will offer a non-pharmacological alternative to support recovery and improve the lives of pregnantand parenting women with OUD and their infant children.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The proposed research aims to develop and advance tools for using image-data appearing in scientific publications, in addition to text, in order to support beneficial, targeted access to the biomedical literature. The number of biomedical publications grows at a rate of over one million new publications per year. Identifying relevant information requires scientists and physicians to scan daily through a myriad of papers. For scientific database curators (bio-curators, in organizations such as Jackson Labs or UniProt), the task is particularly onerous, as they must identify articles most significant to the database, locate within them high-quality evidence concerning disease, genes/proteins and mutations, and curate the findings in database entries along with references to relevant evidence in the articles. Notably, much of the evidence within publications lies in figures. Thus, images are rich and essential indicators for relevance.While biomedical text mining tools are being developed to expedite search for information within publications, several competitive shared tasks underscored the need for more effective tools to overcome the bottleneck for bio-curation and for scientific discovery. Moreover, bio-curators point-out the importance of images as a key information source. While image analysis is an active research field, most current work on biomedical image processing focuses on image identification, understanding and indexing; Not on images as aids to document analysis. Similarly, most work on biomedical literature mining focuses on text alone. Thus, little has been done so far to utilize, in addition to text, images within publications that provide important cues about the relevance of the information embedded in articles.Our premise, supported by bio-curators experience, is that information derived from images can (and should) be directly incorporated into biomedical document retrieval and classification, and will improve accurate identification of relevant articles (for a given user’s needs) while pin-pointing significant evidence within them. We will comprehensively identify, develop and compare informative image-features, develop methods and tools for representing both images and documents based on such features, and introduce means to effectively integrate image-based data into the text-based document classification process. The work will comprise the following fundamental tasks: A) Building robust tools for harvesting images from PDF articles and segmenting compound figures into individual image-panels; B) Identification and investigation of highly-informative features for biomedical image-representation, and categorization of biomedical images into significant types and classes; C) Effective representation of documents using text and image, and integration of text-based and image-based classifiers. We anchor our research in genuine needs, secure access to much image data, and strive for broad-applicability of the results, by working within several broad and diverse curation-areas within institutes with which we collaborate: Evidence for gene-expression & phenotypes in Mouse (Jackson Labs) and in worm (WormBase), and experimental evidence for protein-protein interaction (Protein Information Resource). The work on this project will result in new methods and tools that take advantage of both image- and text-data, facilitating more effective and focused retrieval and mining, thus better supporting bio-curation and data-intensive biomedical discovery.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'To enhance the use of currently available antibiotics, we need to understand how they impact both pathogenic and beneficial bacteria within the host. Identifying methodologies that reduce the impacts of antibiotics on the core microbiome may help to reduce multiple microbiome-related diseases, such as Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea and inflammatory bowel disease. Microbial metabolism is known to be a key modulator of antibiotic susceptibility and we propose that changing the metabolic environment in the microbiome via dietary innervation may reduce the antibiotic susceptibility of beneficial taxa. Our preliminary data indicate that a diet high in plant-derived fiber provides significant protection to the structure of the murine microbiome during antibiotic insult compared to a typical Western low fiber diet. We hypothesize that specific forms of plant-derived polysaccharides can impact bacterial metabolism and thereby modulate antibiotic susceptibility in commensal bacteria. In turn, this modulation may provide protection to microbiome diversity during antibiotic therapy. At this time, however, there is insufficient knowledge to predict how these common dietary components and supplements will impact the structure, function, and response of the microbiome. To overcome this limitation, we will take a multi-omic approach combining metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metabolomics to profile the impacts of plant-derived polysaccharides on the structure, function, and metabolic state of the microbiome and to relate those factors to antibiotic-induced microbiome disruption and resilience. We will conduct this work in the following two aims: Aim 1. Profile the impacts of a fiber-rich diet on the function, structure, and metabolic response of the murine microbiome during antibiotic therapy. Aim 2. Systematically determine the impacts of short-term and long-term purified fiber supplementation on murine microbiome homeostasis and its metabolic response during antibiotic therapy. Understanding the impacts of fiber on antibiotic disruption of the microbiome could have significant translational potential by identifying prebiotic adjuvants that reduce antibiotic-induced dysbiosis. On a basic science level, our metatranscriptomic and metabolomic analysis will allow us to profile how changes in microbiome metabolism can impact antibiotic action. This knowledge can direct future development of targeted therapies that further reduce the off-target impacts of antibiotic treatment.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Mindfulness interventions are efficacious treatment options for individuals struggling with a wide rangeof psychiatric disorders and stressors. Though the use of mindfulness interventions has grown, mindfulnessresearch relies primarily on self-report measurement as treatment targets. As such, the field currently lacks areliable and valid implicit measure of non-judgment of internal experiences as it relates to mindfulness. Expertsin the research field have recently expressed an urgent need for expanded target measures of mindfulnessinterventions, and this project proposes to answer this call by adapting a validated implicit measure (WordSentence Association Paradigm; WSAP) to examine non-judgment of internal experiences (WSAP-NJ). Infollowing the rigorous model for measure development set forth by the PROMIS group, the first step of thisproject will be to conduct a systematic literature review of the current available implicit, performance-based,and behavioral measures of mindfulness. The research team will draw on experts within the mindfulnessresearch field to develop an operational definition of non-judgement of internal experiences, and develop apool of 100 items to be used in the WSAP-NJ. To complete a pilot test of the WSAP-NJ, we will draw fromparticipants already enrolled and completing the Sponsor’s and Co-Sponsor’s ongoing funded research studiesthrough the Mindfulness Center at Brown University and Butler Hospital. One hundred participants willcomplete the WSAP-NJ, and analyses will be run to examine the internal consistency, reliability, and factorstructure of the WSAP-NJ, as well as examine its convergent and divergent validity. Furthermore, we will havethe ability to examine the sensitivity to change of the WSAP-NJ by administering the WSAP-NJ to participantsof a study examining an app-based mindfulness treatment program for anxiety at multiple time points(baseline, 1-month follow up, and 2-month follow up). This pilot study of the WSAP-NJ will provide preliminarydata to inform further field testing of the measure.',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"Chronic musculoskeletal pain creates a significant public health burden, and Veterans aredisproportionately affected. The frequency and extent of co-occurrence of pain and PTSD, painand Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), all three conditions (Post-deployment Multi-symptomDisorder (PMD), and other multi-symptom syndromes can complicate and reduce theeffectiveness of pain treatment.Furthermore, the majority of Veterans do not seek care in VAsettings, requiring an approach that will be available to all Veterans. The Blueprint for RelievingPain in America and National Pain Strategy call for the promotion of self-management; reducingdisparities among vulnerable subgroups (e.g., Veterans); and the tailoring of pain care.Proponents of integrated treatment for common co-morbid conditions are advocating forinterventions that address multiple conditions. This Phase II proposal builds on a successfulNACTS-funded Phase I SBIR that developed and pilot tested a theoretically-grounded, mobile-optimized, interactive pain self-management intervention for Veterans with chronicmusculoskeletal pain. Health eRide: Your Journey to Managing Pain 1) was tailored specificallyto Veterans' readiness and preferred strategies for pain self-management; 2) leveraged SMSmessaging, social networking, and gaming principles to increase engagement and retention; and3) helped to address the co-occurrence of PTSD and TBI by including health behavior changemessages for sleep hygiene and stress management. At 30-day follow-up, participants (n=44)reported significant reductions in pain and pain impact, as well as increased readiness to employself-management strategies. Over 68% of participants reported favorable global impression ofchange. Phase II will involve 1) completing the development of Health eRide by transforming itinto an app and enhancing its functionality for mobile browsers, enhancing the socialnetworking and gaming features, and adding e-coaching capabilities; and 2) conducting a year-long randomized trial in which 540 Veterans with chronic pain recruited from both VA facilitiesand the community are randomly assigned to Health eRide or an online educational cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention. Differences in pain intensity and interference will be examinedat 6 months (immediately post-intervention) and 12-months. A number of secondary analyseswill be conducted to examine the impact Health eRide has on other outcomes (e.g., PTSDsymptoms). A successful trial will set the stage for widespread dissemination of an efficacious,easily accessible tailored pain self-management intervention to address an urgent need amongour nation's Veterans as well as an adaptation for general adult populations.\",\n",

       "   'abstract': 'PROJECT SUMMARY (Exploring the Adaption of Mindfulness in Native American Communities to Address Diabetes)Native Americans have higher rates of contracting, experiencing complications from, and death due to diabetes (1)(2)(3). Several factors may influence health disparities in diabetes, including Native cultural beliefs about diabetes and distrust of western medicine resulting in poor health behaviors (3)(4). Further, as stress is known to exacerbate the effects of diabetes physiologically and through poor health behaviors associated with stress (5)(6)(7), the effects of daily stress may be compounded by historical stress in Native communities (8).Mindfulness-meditation may be an effective means to reduce psychological and physiological stress as well as encourage good health behaviors through heightened attention to diabetes management protocols (9)(10).Although previous studies have indicated that mindfulness practices may be welcome in Native communities (11)(12)(13), there is still little known about the process of adapting mindfulness interventions to Native cultural traditions. We propose to (A) work closely with tribal members to develop trust and support for mindfulness research in the first phase of the K99, (B) develop a core Native-specific MBSR class with optional modules that can be tailored to be Tribe-specific in the second phase of the K99, and (C) in the R00 phase, use two- armed feasibility trials to further develop the core Native-specific mindfulness class with tailored modules and to assess the feasibility of our study design among diabetic adults. Primary outcomes are measures of feasibility and acceptability. Secondary outcomes include behavioral and physiological markers of diabetes management. We hope that these data will motivate an R01-level examination into the efficacy of mindfulness as a means to improve diabetes management and reduce complications due to diabetes in Native communities. This K99/R00 is the preliminary step in the ultimate goal of integrating mindfulness programs with Native contemplative practices as a means to holistically address Native health disparities. These efforts may prove particularly important in a population that has shown a notorious distrust for western medicine.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'In the criminal justice (CJ) system in the US, there are high rates of mental health and substance usedisorders. Although prisons must provide treatment, the CJ system is resource-poor and the presentingproblems of prisoners are diverse. To maximize efficiency in the CJ context, recent efforts focus adjunctiveinterventions on symptoms that are most detrimental to prisoners, and that are shared across diverseconditions. Of particular interest has been anger dysregulation, as this is prevalent in CJ-involved populations,contributing not only to distress and exacerbation of other mental health problems, but also to risk ofaggression. Overt aggression further increases risk for prison behavioral infractions or placement in restraintsor seclusion, and may delay parole or release decisions. There are many limitations to existing approaches toanger management in prison. We propose that hatha yoga could serve as a useful adjunctive treatment foranger within prisons. In addition to preliminary research showing that yoga programs may improve angerregulation, research has also demonstrated benefits of yoga for related symptoms of depression, anxiety, andtrauma-related emotion reactivity and arousal. Yoga may be delivered in a relatively low-cost fashion. Finally,prisoners may view yoga as less stigmatizing than more traditional anger management interventions,particularly given its focus on physical body awareness/movement and on overall wellness. Despite a recentproliferation of yoga programs for various problems in prisons, empirical research on this topic is minimal, witha small number of studies limited by significant methodological concerns. We propose to conduct systematictreatment development research that would prepare us to study whether yoga (vs. a health education controlgroup) is an effective adjunctive treatment for prisoners with anger dysregulation. In Phase 1 (TreatmentDevelopment Stage 1A) of the proposed project, we will refine our current manualized Hatha yoga interventionand health education intervention for specific use with prisoners with high levels of anger dysregulation. We willconduct focus groups with prisoners and prison administrators, and solicit feedback from relevant experts, inorder to make modifications to our yoga and health education treatment manuals. In Phase 2 (TreatmentDevelopment Stage 1B), we will conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial (n = 40) of Hatha yoga vs. a healtheducation group (attention control) for prisoners high in self-reported anger dysregulation. Participants will beenrolled in the active intervention for 10 weeks, and then followed for 8 weeks. We will assess feasibility andacceptability of the yoga program, the health education control group, and research procedures. To assesssafety, we will track all adverse events in a structured fashion. We do not expect to see any serious adverseevents definitely or probably related to study participation. We will iteratively revise manuals and materials,making final revisions at the end of the pilot RCT. If successful, this project will provide us with materials,experience, and pilot data needed for the next stage of this line of research, namely, a fully powered RCT.',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this grant is to use stages 0 and 1 of the NIH stage model to determine the extent to which various measures of self-regulation are assessing distinct or overlapping mechanisms involved in behavior change, and whether the measures perform similarly across populations, contexts, laboratories and age groups. The products of this project will be a systematic collection of validated and documented assays of specific self-regulation targets, and Mindfulness-Based Intervention (MBI) characteristics that engage those targets. These assays and tools will be shared with the field for incorporation in clinical studies and MBI development. Specifically, an interdisciplinary team of 12 basic science and clinical mindfulness researchers from 4 universities (Harvard, Brown, UMass, Georgetown) will (1) create a set of working groups that represent 3 domains of self-regulation (attention, emotion regulation, self-related processing), and (2) employ 4 sets of concurrent studies in order to complete the following aims:  Aim 1: Identify putative self-regulation intervention targets by performing a comprehensive compilation and systematic evaluation of SR target performance in the existing (published) literature (Aim 1a) and from datasets belonging to MRC members or their networks (Aim 1b) using MacLeod and Clarke 2015's method of qualitative meta-analysis.  Aim 2: Identify the conditions that affect (promote or inhibit) self-regulation target engagement, by comparing target performance across variations in assays, samples/conditions, and interventions (i.e. inter- assay validity and inter-laboratory reliability) (Aim 2a) and leveraging 4 sets of existing or ongoing trials that offer variations of targets, samples, health behaviors, and interventions to assess which conditions maximally engage self-regulation targets (Aim 2b) with resulting impacts on health behaviors and medical regimen adherence.  Aim 3: Pilot-test the most promising self-regulation targets and intervention modifications gained from the first 2 phases by inserting them into two ongoing MBI trials for managing chronic medical conditions with 2 different treatment variations in 2 different settings. The Mindfulness-Based Hypertension Therapy (MBHT) study will assess self-regulation target engagement in a controlled research setting while the MINDFUL-Primary Care (PC) study will assess the same targets in a primary care setting with clinical service providers.

       "   'abstract': 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic diseases, such as coronary heart disease [CHD], cancer [CA], diabetes [DM], and HIV, are the leading cause of premature morbidity and mortality in the U. S. The course of all chronic diseases is affected by disease-related and life stress. Stress often leads to anxiety and depression, disturbs neuroendocrine and immune function, triggers unhealthy behaviors, and undermines adherence to medical recommendations. To alleviate the harmful effects of stress, behavioral interventions have been developed for people living with a chronic disease. Primary-level research indicates that behavioral interventions can reduce anxiety and depression but such research often has not had the statistical power needed to inform us about alternative outcomes (e.g., treatment adherence, health behavior change), mediating mechanisms (e.g., neuroendocrine and immunological markers), and moderators of intervention efficacy (e.g., patient or disease characteristics). With the recent surge in published research on complementary and behavioral medicine approaches, the literature is now large enough to permit an integrated meta-analytic investigation, which can have more statistical power. Therefore, the proposed research will use meta-analytic methods to gauge the efficacy of stress management interventions to improve hypothesized biomarkers, treatment adherence, health behaviors, and disease progression - as well as psychological outcomes. We will sample research conducted with people living with four prevalent and costly conditions (CHD, CA, DM, and HIV). The proposed meta-analytic research will further our understanding of the efficacy of behavioral stress management interventions in the context of chronic disease, and help to guide future research toward important unanswered questions. The proposed meta-analytic research will also yield results that will be useful to health care providers, insurers, and policy makers who need precise information to make empirically-derived decisions about the optimal content and duration of an intervention, who is most likely to benefit, and how results may vary across chronic illnesses. Innovative aspects of the proposed research from this well- qualified and highly experienced team include (a) use of state-of-the science meta-analytic methods to integrate a large and complex literature, (b) precise measurement of the psychological, neuroendocrine, and immunological benefits accruing from behavioral stress management interventions, (c) identification of mediators and moderators of intervention efficacy, and (d) comparison of benefit across four prevalent chronic diseases. The research is highly significant because of the prevalence, impact, and cost of the four chronic illnesses, the ubiquity of stress, and the need for effective stress management interventions for multiple chronic conditions. The long-term goal of this research is to guide the development of more powerful, efficient, and cost-effective stress management interventions for people living with a chronic disease.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'PROJECT SUMMARY“Adaptation and pilot study of yoga to reduce depression in adolescents” Recent reports have shown an alarming increase in prevalence of depression in adolescents, particularlygirls, as well as increased numbers of untreated depression in adolescents. This is true despite improvedaccess to health care from 2000 to 2014 across all socioeconomic groups and data supporting moreefficacious treatment of depression in adolescents. Thus, testing alternative approaches to treating depressionin adolescents, including approaches that do not rely on the limited pool of child and adolescent mental healthproviders, is an urgent public health priority. A meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of yoga for depressive symptoms in adultsreported yoga was significantly better than usual care, relaxation, or aerobic exercise in decreasing depressivesymptoms. We recently conducted a 10-week RCT of adjunctive hatha yoga (vs. a health education control) foradults with current or recent major depression, on antidepressant treatment, yet continued to have depressivesymptoms (n=122). Between-group differences in depression symptom severity, while not statisticallysignificant at 10 weeks, were significantly different at the 6-month follow-up period, favoring yoga. Thus, evenin this difficult-to-treat group of adults, hatha yoga had an enduring effect on depressive symptoms. There are various plausible mechanisms by which yoga may have an impact on depression, including self-regulatory mechanisms. Yoga may increase self-compassion and one’s ability to observe one’s thoughts andfeelings as subjective and transient internal experiences rather than objective and permanent reality (i.e.,meta-cognitive awareness). It may also lead to increased heart rate variability, reflecting an improved ability toregulate one’s biological and other responses to stress. To our knowledge, there have not been any studies that rigorously examined yoga in adolescents withclinically significant depression symptoms. Given yoga’s promising results in adults, we believe that hatha yogamay be a useful and safe intervention for depression in adolescents. Using the Participatory Action Researchframework, we propose to adapt yoga for adolescents using step-wise guidelines for adapting manualizedinterventions which include conducting separate focus groups with adolescents (n=24) and parents; solicitingfeedback from experts; making iterative revisions of an instructor manual, and conducting pilot open (n=12)and randomized controlled trials (n=40). We will compare yoga to group CBT, to assess feasibility,acceptability, safety, and within-group changes on depression symptom severity (primary outcome) andfunctional impairment and anxiety (secondary outcomes), as well as changes in potential mechanisms ofaction, including self-compassion, meta-cognitive awareness, and heart rate variability. This pilot project willprovide us with procedures, manuals, and supportive data on feasibility and acceptability that will prepare us toconduct a fully-powered noninferiority design trial of hatha yoga vs. group CBT for depression in adolescents.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods that will identify genes driving epistasis betweenquantitative trait loci. Genetic association studies in both humans and model organisms have been increasinglyable to detect interactions among genetic variants that influence disease risk and pathogenesis. However,identifying which genes are represented by individual variants is a major challenge. Many variants influencingdisease are situated between genes, and even those that are in genes may be representing an effect from aneighboring gene. In model organism studies the situation is even more problematic. In breeding experiments,genetic associations with phenotypes typically encompass large regions of DNA with many genes, andexperimental follow-up to identify the genes responsible for the association is resource-intensive. To addressthis problem, we are developing computational tools to prioritize putative gene interactions in interactinggenomic regions for biological follow-up. We use machine learning classifiers trained on functional gene-geneinteraction networks and combinatorial optimization to identify likely candidate gene-gene interactionsresponsible for epistatic interactions between genomic regions. Our methods sift through enormous spaces ofcandidate interactions, retaining only those whose functional interactions identify as plausible for supportingthe epistatic interaction. These tools hold promise to dramatically limit the resource-intensity of biological followup of putative epistasis and to clarify the genetic architecture of complex disease.',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"Obesity is a risk factor for several preventable diseases. In recent years, there has been a dramatic rise in the consumer use of dietary supplements for weight management. Raspberry ketone [4-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone] is derived from the fruit of the red raspberry (Rubus idaeus) and has purported antiobesity properties. Despite the supplement's consumer popularity, raspberry ketone has not been systematically tested to determine effectiveness for weight loss. The overall objective of this project is to determine the mechanisms by which raspberry ketone decreases feeding and prevents the metabolic consequences of diet-induced obesity. The central hypothesis of this project that raspberry ketone has a dual action to suppress feeding by activation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) channels and to increase fat oxidation mediated by peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor (PPAR) alpha pathways. This proposal will use diet-induced obese (DIO) mice to investigate the acute and long-term effects of raspberry ketone on body weight homeostasis and metabolic signatures. Aim 1 will determine the mechanism(s) by which raspberry ketone suppresses feeding. This will include caloric intake and meal patterns, gene expression of gastrointestinal and hypothalamic feeding-related signals, circulating hormones, and potential for hepatic and intestinal pathology. Aim 2 will determine the mechanism(s) by which raspberry ketone influences metabolic outcomes. This will include measuring energy expenditure, thermoregulatory activity, hemodynamic parameters, and glucose homeostasis. Aim 3 will determine the bioacessibility of raspberry ketone using a functional model of the human digestive system (TNO intestinal model) and in vivo animal model to determine the metabolism and bioavailability of raspberry ketone. The findings from these studies will identify the in vivo mechanisms of preventative actions of raspberry ketone on weight gain and other obesity-related outcomes. The proposed project is relevant to the overall NIH goal of enhancing translational research by providing critical mechanistic data on a commonly used dietary supplement.\",\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Project Summary: This multidisciplinary proposal aims to define how proanthocyanidins (PACs), a major classof grape polyphenols (GPs), alter the intestinal milieu to promote a biological signature associated with resilienceto metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type-2 diabetes (T2D). Using urine, blood, and gut microbiota samples fromPAC-supplemented mice and GP-supplemented humans, microbiome-wide association studies will beperformed to correlate changes in bacterial strains/species to increases/decreases in microbial metabolites(MMs). PAC treatment of bacteria in vitro and of germfree mice inoculated with bacterial isolates or definedconsortia will establish relationships between specific commensal bacteria and PAC-derived MMs, which willthen be tested for bioactivity in mammalian cell culture assays and a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mono-associated germfree (GF) model of MetS/T2D. PACs are associated with metabolic resilience; however,mechanism(s) of systemic protection have remained elusive due to generally poor absorption and uncertaintyabout molecular targets. PACs reach the colon where they are biotransformed to MM with greater bioavailability;however, the specific bacteria responsible for these transformations, the molecular targets of resulting MM, andvalidation of their efficacy in preclinical models of MetS/T2D remain to be investigated. We observed that GPsupplementation can induce a bloom in the mucolytic gut bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila in association withreduced serum lipopolysaccharide, less intestinal and systemic inflammation, increased expression of tightjunction protein occludin, improved glucose metabolism, and less adiposity and weight gain in HFD-fed mice.Increased abundance of A. muciniphila has been observed after gastric bypass surgery and metformin treatment,underlining its importance in positive metabolic outcomes. GP-supplemented mice also showed: 1) decreasedbacterial community richness; 2) alterations in genera consistent with improved gut barrier integrity and lacticacid-production; 3) decreased serum levels of bacterial-derived secondary bile acids; 4) decreased thickness ofthe mucus layer adjacent to the intestinal epithelium with redistribution of mucus in the colon; and 5) increasedserum levels of desaminotyrosine (DAT), a PAC-derived MM associated with immune modulation and resilienceagainst virus-induced inflammation. Finally, we showed that PACs, are sufficient to increase intestinalabundance of A. muciniphila. Our data suggest PAC-induced alterations of the intestinal milieu promotemetabolic resilience. To establish cause-effect relationships we propose to: 1) correlate urine/blood metaboliteswith gut bacterial strains/species using samples collected in longitudinal studies of GP-supplemented humansand PAC-treated mice with concomitant monitoring of metabolic and histological phenotypes in HFD- and low-fat diet (LFD)-fed murine hosts; 2) perform in vitro and germfree mouse studies to confirm relationship of specificbacteria isolate/consortia to specific MM; 3) investigate bioactivities of PAC-derived MM in cell-based assaysrelated to glucose metabolism and the B29-monoassociated GF mouse model of HFD-induced MetS/T2D.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'PROJECT SUMMARY:The dietary benefits of tryptophan have been classically linked to its property as an essential amino acid requiredby mammals for protein synthesis, but recent work in the past decade has revealed its equally essential role asan important source of metabolites for the microbial community to generate signals, mainly via the ArylHydrocarbon Receptor (AHR), to affect a plethora of cellular functions. AHR signaling pathway is highlypromiscuous not only responding to diverse ligands with resembling structures, but also crosstalk with and ismodulated by numerous cellular signaling pathways. Distinct agonists can result in ligand selective differencesin AHR structure and function, ultimately leading to agonist-selective gene expression and biological effects. Inthe gut, AHR activation by bacterial tryptophan catabolites influences mucosal homeostasis and microbiotacomposition. Although bacterial tryptophan metabolites and AHR axis may contribute to microbial sensing andtolerance, it is unclear if probiotics and pathobionts produce distinct tryptophan metabolites thereby elicitingbacterial species- and agonist-specific host mucosal modulating effects. Both Lactobacillus and Ruminoccocusspp catabolize tryptophan to a variety of tryptamine and indolic products that bind at low to high affinities to theAHR. The identities and specific biological effects of tryptophan metabolites produced by the probioticLactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and the pathobiont R. gnavus are currently unknown. Preliminary RNA-Seqanalysis of mouse intestinal mucosa perfused with live LGG revealed a robust induction of AHR signaling activityas well as anti-inflammatory cytokines. Bacterial 16s rRNA sequencing and untargeted fecal metabolomicsscreening of a newly engineered Lyz1 knockout mouse model revealed a dysbiosis featured by expansion ofmucolytic bacterial species (e.g., R. gnavus), accompanied by a pronounced elevation of tryptophan metabolitesand a changed epithelial cell composition. The hypothesis is that the probiotic LGG and the pathobiont R. gnavusmetabolize dietary tryptophan into distinct agonists that elicit differential mucosal modulating effects via the hostAHR signaling. Aim I will use mono-colonization of germ-free mice, dietary tryptophan depletion, unbiasedmetabolomics profiling, and isogenic mutant bacteria deficient in tryptophan-metabolizing to identify LGG and R.gnavus specific tryptophan metabolites and their differential mucosal modulating effects. Aim 2 will employorganoid culture, intraluminal perfusion of AHR agonists, and genetic ablation of host AHR signaling to determinethe direct effects of bacterial species-specific tryptophan metabolites and AHR signaling on Lyz1-deficient mousemucosal homeostasis and colitis susceptibility. This MPI project uses rigorous approaches, includinggnotobiotics, bacterial genetics, dietary manipulation, and unbiased metabolomics, etc. to address an importantmechanism involving diet-microbe-host interaction that may underlie the biological natures of probiotics andpathobionts. The two PIs have a history of productive collaboration, and have demonstrated experiences instudying intestinal physiology. This project employing innovative animal models is significant for public healthand disease intervention.',\n",

Currently,RK is marketed and sold in the US as a popular dietary supplement for the managementof body weight. One of the primary aims of the parent grant is to examine thebioavailability and metabolic fates of RK in mouse models. The objective of thissupplement is to optimize and fully validate our comprehensive analytical methodsintegrating liquid-liquid phenolic extraction, microelution solid-phase extraction (µSPE),lipid removal and sample clean-up, and targeted metabolomics using UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS, for efficient and reliable analysis of RK and its metabolites in plasma, brain, liverand WAT specimens to support the RK pharmacokinetic and bioavailability studies. Forthe proposed supplement project, first we will further optimize the method developed forbioanalysis of plasma and expand the application to the lipid-rich tissues e.g. brain, liverand white adipose tissue (WAT) (Aim 1); we will then conduct full validation for themethods developed including the reliability characteristics of Limit of detection (LOD),Limit of quantification (LOQ), Calibration linearity, Compound stability, Accuracy,Repeatability/Precision, Recovery, and Matrix effects following the FDA's BioanalyticalMethod Validation Guidance for Industry (Aim 2). Outcomes from this AdministrativeSupplement studies will ensure sensitive, accurate and reproducible quantitativeanalysis of RK and derived metabolites following oral administration of RK in obesityprevention and provide innovative and reliable approaches for others to examine RK andRK structurally-related phenolics in RK-enriched botanical preparations in vivo. Theproposed project is also relevant to the overall NIH goal of supporting the performanceand publication of formal single-laboratory validation studies of quantitative analyticalmethods.\",\n",

       "   'abstract': \"\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional application aims to provide the answer to a key question in human health and nutrition: how do poorly bioavailable dietary polyphenols from fruits and vegetables lower the risk of chronic diseases, such as metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type-2 diabetes (T2D), associated with low-grade chronic inflammation. Using a high fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type-2 diabetes (T2D) murine model coupled with metagenomics and transcriptomics, we will investigate the hypothesis that poorly bioavailable dietary polyphenols from fruits and vegetables act directly in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to remodel the gut microbiota and reducelocal and systemic inflammation via interdependent mechanisms resulting in a reduction in chronic disease risk. While epidemiological, clinical and preclinical studies suggest that consumption of polyphenol-rich foods is associated with reduced risk of MetS and T2D, the mechanism(s) of protection offered by polyphenols has remained elusive due to generally poor polyphenol absorption and distribution to target tissues. Recent studies have shown that consumption of a HFD perturbs gut microbiota ecology and promotes intestinal inflammation, which precedes the development of obesity and insulin resistance characteristic of MetS/T2D. Studies in germ- free (GF; i.e. gnotobiotic) or antibiotic-treated mice demonstrated that consumption of HFD in the absence of gut microbiota protected mice from developing the clinical features of MetS/T2D, implicating the gut microbiota as a key player in the etiology of metabolic diseases. The proposed studies aim to show that poorly bioavailable polyphenols provide resilience to MetS/T2D by changing gut microbiota ecology thus reducing inflammation in the intestine. In collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Peter Turnbaugh, a leading gut microbiota expert at Harvard University we will: 1) Use the HFD-fed C57BL/6J model of MetS/T2D to test the effects of purified polyphenol fractions from grape and cranberry on microbiome ecology, intestinal inflammation, gut barrier integrity, oral glucose tolerance and adiposity; 2) Study the dose response of polyphenols on gut microbiota and oral glucose tolerance in MetS/T2D mice and test the direct effects of polyphenols on microbiota ecology and physiology in vitro and; 3) Use antibiotic- treated MetS/T2D mice, depleted of their gut microbiota, to test direct polyphenol effects on intestinal inflammation and glucose tolerance in the absence of the gut microbiota. The proposed experiments will evaluate the host physiological and nutrigenomic responses to dietary polyphenols and relate these responses to the changes in host microbiota to provide an integrated mechanistic explanation for the health benefits of polyphenol-rich diets. Successful completion of proposed studies may substantiate the old wisdom that 'an apple a day keeps the doctor away.'\",\n",

       "   'abstract': 'PROJECT SUMMARYThe United States is experiencing an opioid use and overdose crisis. To address the epidemic, a wide range of strategies to treat opioid use disorders are being implemented across the country, and New Jersey is expanding and enhancing medication assisted treatment (MAT) services with a State Targeted Response to the Opioid Crisis Grant. MAT is the most effective intervention for an opioid use disorder (OUD), and methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is the most commonly prescribed MAT; however, approximately half of people who begin MMT discontinue within a year, and half of people retained in MMT have an opioid relapse within six months. Chronic pain, affecting most people on MMT, could be contributing to relapse in this group. Novel behavioral interventions that address both chronic pain and opioid relapse among people on MAT are needed. Although several behavioral therapies have shown efficacy in separately treating pain and opioid use, few interventions exist which address these co-occurring problems simultaneously. However, Mindfulness Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) was recently developed to treat both pain and opioid misuse. MORE is a group intervention that combines training in mindfulness, cognitive reappraisal, and positive emotion regulation skills to target the dysfunctional cognitive, affective, and behavioral pathways that lead to opioid use relapse. Moreover, an early stage trial of MORE has demonstrated its efficacy in reducing subjective assessments of pain severity, pain related dysfunction, opioid craving, and opioid misuse. However, to date, this promising intervention has never been tested as an adjunctive therapy to prevent relapse and address chronic pain among people with an OUD on MAT.The objective of this proposal is to examine the impact of MORE on opioid relapse and chronic pain among individuals receiving MMT. Our central hypothesis is that MMT effectiveness will be enhanced by an adjunctive behavioral treatment that helps patients cope with the chronic pain, stress, and emotion dysregulation that could lead to opioid relapse. We will first conduct a small pilot study to test the feasibility of our study methods (R21; N=30). We will then conduct a larger study (R33; N=150, estimated) to assess MORE with respect to a range of clinical outcomes. Both studies will involve a 2-arm, individually randomized controlled trial design that compares MORE to MMT as usual (TAU). With the R21, we aim to pilot study protocol to determine feasibility. This study phase will focus on establishing study feasibility in recruiting, retaining, and following up study participants. With the R33, we aim to 1) determine MORE efficacy relative to TAU and 2) explore mediators of opioid use outcomes. If this study is successful, it could identify a promising intervention for helping people on MMT to cope with the stress and dysfunction associated with chronic pain, reduce their risk of opioid use relapse, and enhance their overall quality of life.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Dynamic brain signals provide key information that can be deciphered for a better understanding of brainfunction. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has been developed to map not only the activitypattern but also functional connectivity in the whole brain. Although it has been over twenty years sincethe development of fMRI and the resting-state fMRI, the key challenge of fMRI-based signal interpretationremains to be the temporal and spatial resolution limit of the hemodynamic signal detected by fMRI. Inmost fMRI studies, the size of these voxels pre-determines the limits of the basic biological conclusion.With recent advancement leading to dramatic improvement in spatiotemporal resolution of MRI, thedynamic signal feature can be better clarified, which will significantly improve our understanding of brainfunction.In this proposal, a merged effort from three research groups is made to study the neural and vascularcorrelates of laminar-specific resting state fMRI signal fluctuation, which underlies the functional connectivitymapping in both human and animal models at varied brain states. Since the first report of large scale spatialsignal correlation in fMRI images (Biswal et al, 1995), the drastically improved spatiotemporal resolution ofhigh-field fMRI has revealed a number of key networks in the brain relevant to the default mode, attention,cognition, and sensorimotor connections. However, the millimeter size of voxels for resting-state and taskresults in fMRI signal dominated by large venous vessels. Although numerous studies have been designedto exclude signal contribution from veins, the neuronal correlates of resting-state and task fMRI signal hasbeen heavily linked to vascular contributions. It remains a challenge to disentangle the distinct neuronal andvascular contribution to fMRI signal fluctuation given the limited spatial and temporal resolution.As connectivity measures are increasingly being used, a number of groups are beginning to focus on mindbody interactions. In particular, connectivity measures, both local and global are being used in brain regionsincluding insula and thalamus to better understand more complex brain behavior interactions.',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"Excessive and chronic inflammation can contribute to many acute andchronic diseases including autoimmune disease, neurological, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Increasingevidence suggests that chronic inflammation is closely associated with epigenetic alterations, mediated byDNA and histone modifications, driving changes in the expression of many inflammatory genes, such asIL1R1, IL-1β, toll-like receptor 2, 15-LOX, COX-2, CXCL14, CCL25, CXCL6, IL13, IL17C and IL4R. Importantlyseveral classes of natural CAM products including indole-3-carbinol and triterpenoids possess antiinflammatoryand epigenetic-modifying properties. Our Preliminary Studies show that: (1) the epigenetic CpGmethylation status of inflammatory genes were altered in TRAMP prostate tumor as compared to the wild typecontrol using MeDIP-seq technology; (2) in 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP)-inducedinflammation/high-grade PIN (HGP) in the prostate of CYP1A-humanized mice, inflammatory markers such as8-oxo-dG, nitrotyrosine, COX-2, p-AKT, and PTEN were increased; (3) inflammatory infiltrates were increasedin mouse prostate specific Pten-/- HGP; and (4) Indole-3-carbinol (I3C)/3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) fromcruciferous vegetables and triterpenoid ursolic acid (UA) from medicinal plants, fruits and vegetables such asblueberries, cranberry, beets, and mushrooms, which possess potent anti-inflammatory activities in differenttypes of cells, were found to trigger epigenetics modifying activities. Despite these promising results, theepigenomic changes and the underlying epigenetics mechanisms of prostate inflammation and relateddiseases including prostate cancer (PCa) and how CAM products epigenetically modified the inflammatoryepigenome leading to inhibition of these aberrant processes remains unknown. Based on our preliminarystudies and previous published reports, we hypothesize that chronic inflammatory processes would drivechanges of inflammatory epigenome and CAM products would modify these inflammatory epigenomicalterations resulting in suppression of inflammation and its related diseases including cancer in theprostate with three Specific Aims: (1) To investigate the epigenome alterations imparted by I3C andtriterpenoid UA in prevention of prostate inflammation and carcinogenesis in Pten-/-, PhiP-hCYP1A andTRAMP mice; (2) To determine the preventive efficacy and epigenetic alterations elicited by I3C andtriterpenoid UA in human prostate VCaP xenograft in NCr(-/-) mice; and (3) To elucidate the in vitroepigenetic mechanisms of regulation of the inflammatory/oxidative stress and pro-apoptotic genesobtained from in vivo Aims 1 and 2 by DIM and triterpenoid UA in TRAMP C1, Pten-CaP2, VCaP andLNCaP cell culture system. Better understanding of the epigenetics mechanisms of how CAM productsinhibit inflammation and its related disease would open new avenue of approaches for the prevention andtreatment of chronic inflammatory diseases including the PCa in human.\",\n",

       "   'abstract': 'PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACTThe human-associated microbiota has recently been established as a critical determinant of health anddisease. It has attracted wide interest across medical disciplines with the promise of novel microbiota-targetedtherapies that can effectively shift the microbiota toward a health-promoting state. The microbiota is noted forits exceptional complexity, with intricate metabolic networks governing microbial symbiotic and competitiveinteractions. The simultaneous use of multiple ‘omics technologies for characterizing the microbiota has beenrecognized broadly by the research community as a powerful approach because it can expose the interactionsbetween the various components of the microbiota and link microbiota composition and function, a keyrequirement of targeted therapy development. However, the success of this approach depends on thedevelopment of computational and statistical methods for identifying the high-order interactions in themicrobiota that are relevant for influencing disease risk and for bridging multiple high-dimensional ‘omics datastreams. We aim to address this methodological gap by developing, evaluating, applying and distributing a newset of tools for performing meaningful analysis and integration of ‘omics data for human microbiota studies. Wewill frame the development of our tools around two of the most powerful and widely-used technologies forcharacterizing the human-associated microbiota: (1) sequence-based microbial taxonomic profiling forcharacterizing microbial community composition and (2) spectroscopy-based untargeted metabolomic profilingfor characterizing microbial community function. We will first develop and evaluate a method for integratingmulti-omic data streams that leverages publicly available databases of microbial metabolic pathways. Next, wewill develop a method for mapping associations between composition and clinical outcomes through the lens ofmicrobiota functional profiles. We will then apply our methods for identifying microbial communities and theirphenotypes associated with clinical endpoints in a large cohort. Finally, our methods will be released to thehuman microbiota research community as an open-source software package. The work we propose will buildanalytic tools that perform functional integration of multiple ‘omics data streams and evaluate complexrelationships with clinical outcomes. This represents a novel framework for identifying microbiota-healthassociations and their functional underpinnings in a manner that embraces the complexity of this system. Thesignificance of this work lies in its potential to help translate experimental and human subjects studies of themicrobiota into targeted therapies that shift the microbiota toward a health-promoting state.',\n",

The QBS program was founded in 2010 to provide cross-training in quantitative, computational and biomedical sciences to prepare students for a new research landscape that is increasingly characterized by complex problems, big data and multidisciplinary teams. The QBS program spans the entire Dartmouth College campus including faculty from the Schools of Arts and Sciences, Business, Engineering and Medicine. QBS admits 6-8 students per year from different backgrounds including computer science, mathematics, biology, chemistry, and engineering. These students are selected from a highly qualified national and international pool of candidates that are rich in both ethnic and racial diversity. As part of the proposed T32 training program, we will select two highly qualified predoctoral students each year for two years of support based on academic qualifications and a dissertation project that will focus on big data. The predoctoral trainees will complete an eight course core curriculum that will include two courses in computer science or data science, two courses in bioinformatics, two courses in biostatistics, two courses in epidemiology and a two course sequence in integrative biomedical sciences that exposes students to interdisciplinary research and that culminates in a collaborative big data class project. Students in this program take two elective courses, one term of teaching, journal clubs and seminars, training in responsible conduct of research, a written and oral qualifier exam, a yearly research in progress seminar, and the completion of a significant research project that forms the foundation of the written dissertation that is orally defended. Faculty trainers include QBS and computer science faculty that have extramural funding, a strong track record of graduate training experience, a strong track record of big data research and a commitment to participating in the activities necessary for successful predoctoral training. Research areas of the faculty include bioinformatics, biostatistics, computer science, computational biology, genomics, and epidemiology. It is our vision that the next generation of big data researchers need multiple skills and expertise from areas such as bioinformatics, biostatistics, computer science and epidemiology to bring together teams of researchers.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTMost colorectal cancer cases start as a small growth, known as a polyp, on the lining of the colon or rectum.Although colorectal polyps are precursors to colorectal cancer, it takes several years for these polyps topotentially transform into cancer. If colorectal polyps are detected early, they can be removed before they canprogress to cancer. The microscopic examination of stained tissue from colorectal polyps on glass slides—thepractice of histopathology—is a key part of colorectal cancer screening and forms the current basis forprognosis and patient management. Histopathological characterization of polyps is an important principle fordetermining the risk of colorectal cancer and future rates of surveillance for patients; however, it is time-intensive, requires years of specialized training, and suffers from high variability and low accuracy. In addition,as is evident by the domain literature, other health factors, such as medical and family history, play animportant role in colorectal cancer risk; however, they are not considered in current standard guidelines forcolorectal cancer risk assessment. Therefore, there is a critical need for computational tools that canincorporate both histopathological and relevant clinical/familial information to help clinicians better characterizecolorectal polyps and more accurately assess risk for colorectal cancer.To address this critical need, this application proposes to build a novel, automatic, image-analysis method thatcan accurately detect and classify different types of colorectal polyps on whole-slide microscopic images. Theproposed approach will be able to identify discriminative regions and features on these images for eachcolorectal polyp type, which will provide support and insight into the automatic detection of colorectal polyps onwhole-slide images. Finally, this project will provide an accurate risk prediction model to integrate visualhistology features from microscopic images with other risk factors and relevant clinical information frommedical records for a comprehensive colorectal cancer risk assessment. The proposed image analysis andprediction methods in this project are based on a novel deep-learning methodology and rely on numerouslevels of abstraction for data representation and analysis. The technology developed in this proposal will berigorously validated on data from patients undergoing colorectal cancer screening at the investigators’academic medical center and on the records from the New Hampshire statewide colonoscopy data registry.Upon successful completion of this project, the proposed bioinformatics approach is expected to reduce thecognitive burden on pathologists and improve their accuracy and efficiency in the histopathologicalcharacterization of colorectal polyps and in subsequent risk assessment and follow-up recommendations. As aresult, this project can have a significant, positive impact on improving the efficacy of colorectal cancerscreening programs, precision medicine, and public health.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'PROJECT SUMMARYSmoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the US. Effective smoking cessation interventions areavailable but underutilized. Smoking cessation interventions delivered by smartphone apps are a promisingtool for helping smokers quit. Delivery of treatments via smartphone apps may maximize the likelihood of useby smokers and the potential impact on smoking behavior. However, currently available smartphone apps forsmoking cessation have not exploited their unique potential advantages to aid quitting. Notably, no availableapps utilize wearable technologies; all current apps require users to self-report their smoking; and no appsdeliver treatment automatically contingent upon smoking. Therefore, this pilot trial will test the feasibility ofusing a smartband to detect and track smoking and deliver brief smoking cessation interventions bysmartphone app in real time. The interventions to be delivered will be brief mindfulness exercises that havebeen previously shown to reduce craving and smoking. This trial uses SmokeBeat, a novel mobile technologyplatform that uses multimodal data from wristband sensors to monitor and detect smoking, notify smokersabout their smoking in real time and deliver real time interventions triggered by detected smoking episodes.SmokeBeat also applies machine learning to smoking tracking data to identify individual smoking patterns anddeliver real time interventions targeted at predicted smoking episodes. This trial tests a three-step interventionto reduce smoking, in which smokers first become aware of their smoking and triggers by tracking smoking;then gain a clear recognition of the actual effects of smoking by “mindful smoking”; and finally learn to workmindfully with cravings rather than smoke. Briefly, daily smokers (N=200, ≥5 cig/day) will wear a smartband todetect and notify them of smoking for 21 days and obtain individual smoking profiles; detected smoking willthen trigger a “mindful smoking” exercise for the next 7 days leading up to their quit date at 30 days; afterwhich another mindfulness exercise (“RAIN”: recognize, accept, investigate and note cravings rather thansmoke) will be delivered prior to each predicted smoking episode according to their individual smoking profilefor 30 days post-quit. Aim 1 will be to determine treatment fidelity. Fidelity measures will be: (1) percent ofsmoking episodes correctly detected; (2) percent of “mindful smoking” exercises correctly triggered bysmoking; and (3) users’ real time ratings of how timely “RAIN” was delivered to predicted smoking episodes.Aim 2 will be to determine adherence to treatment. Adherence measures will be: (1) percent of time spentwearing the smartband; (2) percent of smoking notifications answered; (3) percent of ecological momentaryassessment (EMA) ratings (e.g., timeliness and others) answered; and (4) percent of mindfulness exercisescompleted. Aim 3 will be to determine the acceptability of treatment. Acceptability measures will be: (1)average helpfulness ratings after each mindfulness exercise; (2) feedback on user experience surveys.Overall: this project tests a highly innovative technology-based mindfulness intervention for smoking cessation.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Project SummaryBeyond its well-established role in maintaining systemic calcium homeostasis, a substantial and growing body ofresearch points to the physiological importance of vitamin D as a neuroactive steroid. Despite such data,experimental evidence of vitamin D’s direct effects on brain function in humans is all but lacking. This gaphinders both our understanding of the role of vitamin D in human behavior as well as its therapeutic potentialfor neuropsychiatric disorders (i.e., including and beyond vitamin deficiency states).Recent preclinical (rodent) research by members of our group demonstrate important modulatory effects of thephysiologically active form of vitamin D, calcitriol, on mesolimbic dopamine (DA) systems. These datademonstrate: 1) expression of VDRs in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) containing DA neurons of the ventraltegmental area (VTA) and dopamine D2/3 receptor-expressing cells in striatum/nucleus accumbens (NAc); andthey further show that acute calcitriol administration: 2) increases TH expression in VTA DA neurons; 3)increases dopamine D2/3 receptor mRNA in NAc; 4) increases microdialysate (“tonic”) and cyclic voltammetry(“phasic”) measures of striatal DA release (including in response to amphetamine); 5) increases amphetamine-induced locomotion, and 6) decreases drug (amphetamine) self-administration in animals. If also true ofhumans, such effects would be of considerable clinical importance, given the number of human behaviors (e.g.,learning, memory, reward, affective and information processing, etc.) mediated by mesolimbic/subcortical DAcircuits and the number of disorders (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, addiction, depression,Parkinson’s disease, etc.) in which mesolimbic/subcortical DA deficits have been implicated.The current exploratory/developmental R01 seeks to test this hypothesis directly in healthy humans.Specifically, we will assess subcortical DA function (in vivo DA release) in 20 medically and psychiatrically healthy(vitamin D sufficient) humans using high-resolution 11C-PHNO PET. Specifically, subjects (N=20) will participatein four 11C-PHNO PET sessions, including two pairs of pre- and post-amphetamine (0.3 mg/kg PO) scans of D2/3receptor availability (BPND) conducted on two separate days two weeks apart. Scan days will be preceded byplacebo/active calcitriol (3.0 µg) pretreatment per a fully randomized, double-blind, counterbalanced, placebo-controlled, within-subject design. We hypothesize that calcitriol will increase amphetamine-stimulated DArelease as reflected by greater reductions in ventral striatal D2/3 receptor availability (∆BPND) on active vs. placebodays and that such changes will be accompanied by parallel improvements in DA-mediated behaviors.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Background: Converging lines of evidence from preclinical studies, treatment studies in animals, and anecdotal reports suggest that cannabidiol (CBD) may have a therapeutic role in chronic pain disorders. Emerging neurobiological evidence suggests that the transition from acute to chronic pain is mediated by a) the biological mechanism of increased brain microglial activation and b) the physiological mechanism of increased central pain-sensitization. However, whether CBD modulates brain microglial activation and central pain-sensitization in humans has not been examined to-date. Intradermal capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia (ICSH) is a validated measure of central pain-sensitization related to activation of specific brain regions. We have demonstrated, in pilot data, that ICSH is sensitive to the effects of cannabinoids (such as THC) in a laboratory paradigm. Low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been shown to increase brain microglial activation. The combination of LPS and intradermal capsaicin provides a unique experimental paradigm to examine the relationship between brain microglial activation and central pain-sensitization. Harnessing the high sensitivity and molecular specificity of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we have demonstrated in vivo evidence of increased brain microglial activation following LPS, using [11C]PBR28. Additionally, LPS has been shown to result in a 2-fold increase in capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia (ICSH). The combination of LPS with intradermal capsaicin (pLPS-IC) thus provides a validated and reliable model to examine the effects of CBD on a) the biological mechanism of increased brain microglial activation and b) the physiological mechanism of increased central pain-sensitization.Hypothesis #1: CBD pretreatment will result in lower brain microglial activation (specifically in the thalamus) compared to placebo in healthy individuals. Aim#1: To examine the effect of CBD pretreatment on brain microglial activation in vivo in humans using a LPS-challenge paradigm and [11C]PBR28 PET imaging. Hypothesis #2: The degree of reduction in brain microglial activation with CBD pretreatment will correlate with the degree of reduction in central pain-sensitization. Aim#2: To examine the relationship between microglial activation and central pain-sensitization with CBD pretreatment, measured using [11C]PRB28 and ICSH in a pLPS-IC paradigm.',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"Project SummaryDrug metabolites can have distinct efficacy and toxicity profiles relative to the parent compound, andinterpersonal variation in drug metabolism can determine adverse reactions. Notably, oral drugs that exhibitlow bioavailability, are delivered in delayed release formulations, or are excreted through bile can encounterenormous densities of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. The gut microbiome carries a collective genecontent 150-fold larger than the human genome, encodes a rich repository of enzymes with the potentialcapacity to metabolize drugs, and varies widely between individuals. The microbiome thus has the potential toimpact serum drug and metabolite exposure. However, scalable in vitro systems for identification of activemicrobial species, enzymes, and candidate drug metabolites are not available. Our understanding ofmicrobiome-mediated drug metabolism is largely limited to anecdotal examples, and it is unknown whether gutmicrobes encode enzymes that metabolize many drugs. Strategies for determining the quantitative contributionof gut microbial drug metabolism to serum drug and metabolite exposure are also not available.We developed high-throughput approaches that generate metabolomic time-series profiles of the metabolismof hundreds of drugs by hundreds of human gut microbial communities and species, uncover the microbiome-encoded enzymes responsible for these transformations, and identify candidate drug metabolites produced asa result. We also provide evidence that combining gnotobiotics with physiologically-based pharmacokineticmodeling can quantitatively disentangle host and microbial contributions to serum drug metabolite exposure invivo, using a drug that is converted into a single metabolite by host and microbiome as a proof of concept.In Aim 1 of this proposal, we present a plan to establish the first repertoire of drug-metabolizing enzymes in thehuman gut microbiome. These results will reveal whether human gut microbes encode enzymes thatmetabolize many drugs and whether microbiome genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes serve aspredictive biomarkers of the drug-metabolizing capacity of an individual's microbiome. In Aim 2, we describe astrategy to develop and test generalized host-microbiome pharmacokinetic models that capture host andmicrobial conversion of a drug into multiple metabolites and include enterohepatic circulation in the modeltopology. If successful, these aims will establish broadly applicable approaches to identify when and how themicrobiome could contribute to the metabolism of drugs and other small molecules.\",\n",

       "   'abstract': 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTCognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pain (CBT-CP) is an evidence-based psychological intervention that iseffective for reducing pain and improving function for patients with chronic pain. Numerous barriers exist toface-to-face delivery of this treatment, including patient travel limitations, the need for frequent in-personsessions, and the scarcity of trained therapists. Leveraging technology-based interventions, like interactivevoice response (IVR), which allow patients to engage in treatment from their home, may improve access toCBT-CP. The overall goal of this project is to conduct a pragmatic trial to examine the real world effectivenessof an IVR-based form of CBT-CP called COoperative Pain Education and Self-management (COPES). In thespirit of pragmatic trials, our approach will minimize clinic disruption and avoid adding research staff in the fieldby using the VHA’s electronic health record (EHR) to facilitate recruitment and to collect data, all whiledelivering COPES from a centralized VA location. In preparation for the pragmatic trial, the initial study phase(UG3) will: a) identify facilities to participate in the trial from among the 60 Women’s Health Practice BasedNetwork (WH-PBRN) sites, b) examine the adequacy of the EHR for providing outcome data, c) determine thefeasibility of using EHR provider alerts to promote recruitment and d) secure all regulatory approvals along withsupport from leadership at selected sites. Phase two (UH3) will then compare outcomes among Veteransrandomized to either: 1) COPES, a 10-week IVR-based CBT and walking program plus any providerprescribed pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain treatments (COPES+UC), or 2) in-person CBT-CPprovided by clinicians, previously trained through VHA’s evidence based psychotherapy program plus anyprovider prescribed pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments (VHA CBT-CP+UC). Patients will becompared on a composite measure of pain intensity and functioning, EHR pain intensity, and health care useincluding emergency department, urgent care, and specialty pain services along with pharmacological andnon-pharmacological pain interventions. Uptake and variation in outcomes across groups will also beevaluated where treatment disparities are possible (e.g. by sex, race, mental health comorbidities).Additionally, the cost of the COPES intervention will be examined, including intervention delivery expendituresand budget impact analysis. Finally, evaluation of the intervention process will be informed by the ConsolidatedFramework for Implementation Research (CFIR). CFIR-guided interviews with study site clinicians andadministrators will assess experiences with the COPES and CBT-CP interventions and implementationfindings will be communicated with participating sites and stakeholders.',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"AbstractIn 2015 alone, 97,223 new Veterans under age 35 began receiving compensation for injuries related to theirmilitary service. In total, there are 559,999 post-9/11 Veterans being compensated for back or neck conditions,and a partially overlapping 596,250 for limitation of flexion in joints. Veterans seeking compensation formusculoskeletal conditions often develop chronic pain and are at high risk for substance misuse. Earlyintervention is needed to arrest worsening pain and risky substance use, particularly among post-9/11Veterans for whom engagement in non-pharmacological pain treatment has the potential to improve theiroverall quality of life and spare them the complications of opioid treatments. The service-connection applicationis an ideal point-of-contact for initiating early intervention treatments for these at-risk Veterans. We propose totest the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for PainManagement (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and risky substance use. In brief, the counselor explainsthat treating both physical and psychological aspects of pain leads to the best outcomes, outlines what VA(and non-VA if preferred) services are available to Veterans, explains that substances are sometimes used forpain relief, and segues into traditional SBIRT. SBIRT-PM's efficacy is supported by a completed clinical trial of101 Veterans applying for service-connection for MSD, and by studies showing the efficacy of SBIRT forpeople with risky substance use and of Motivational Interviewing for engagement in non-pharmacological paincare. The study will involve a two-year period to arrange for clinicians at a single “hub” site to counselVeterans throughout New England by phone with SBIRT-PM, and a four-year period to conduct the clinical trialand disseminate its findings. During the two-years of preparation for the clinical trial, the team will prepareSBIRT-PM for implementation by establishing communication (Relational Coordination is the theoreticalframework) between the “hub” where the SBIRT-PM clinician is sited and the “spoke” sites, establishing study-related procedures, and piloting the intervention at each of the eight VA medical centers in New England. Forthe full clinical trial, we will randomize 1200 Veterans applying for compensation related to MSD to eitherSBIRT-PM or Usual Care (UC) across eight VA medical centers in New England. Outcome assessment byphone will occur at 12 and 36-week follow-ups, and will be corroborated with other sources of information ---theelectronic health record and toxicology testing of nail clippings. We hypothesize that, compared to Usual Care,SBIRT-PM will be more effective and cost-effective in improving Veterans' pain and substance use. We furtherhypothesize that a mediator of these improvements will be use of non-pharmacological services, as extractedfrom VA records from structured data fields and from narrative text in the medical record using an innovativenatural language processing algorithm. Screening and referral to treatment at service-connectionexaminations can transform a widely-used point of entry to VA into a health-promoting encounter.\",\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Abstract/SummaryAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects 11% of children and leads to adverse outcomes[1,2]. These include impaired psychosocial, educational, and neuropsychological development, lower achievement levels across domains, and distress, often continuing into adulthood[3–7]. Medications, while often effective in reducing certain ADHD symptoms, have many disadvantages, including misuse and side effects[8–15]. Behavioral interventions do not have these adverse effects, but they are not as effective[9,10]. Mindfulness has been the subject of increasing academic and clinical attention[16]. In recent years, it has been studied in adult populations for a variety of medical and psychiatric conditions, and it is known to be effective across disorders, including ADHD[17–34]. Moreover, we and others have shown that it improves attention and emotion regulation, and alters resting state brain activity and connectivity[35,36]. However, investigations in children and adolescents are far less common[37–40]. To our knowledge, mindfulness as an intervention for ADHD in elementary school children has not been systematically and rigorously studied. We propose to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of Mindfulness-Based ADHD Treatment for Children (MBAT-C), a novel neuroscience-informed intervention for elementary school children, in an underserved area.MBAT-C is designed for children at precisely the age when ADHD-relevant neurocognitive systems are developing and clinical symptoms begin to appear. There is reason to believe that this innovative treatment will succeed in treating ADHD, given the overlap between neuroscientific mechanisms by which mindfulness exerts its effects and the neurobiology of ADHD[41–44]. Proposed mechanisms of mindfulness include modulation of subsystems of attention, suggesting that a treatment program that targets the attention regulation capacities impaired in elementary school children with ADHD may be efficacious. Forty-five children from Southwest Community Health Center in Bridgeport, CT will be recruited to participate in this randomized- controlled feasibility trial that will compare MBAT-C and medication. Aim 1 is to finalize the MBAT-C manual. Aim 2 is to evaluate the feasibility of MBAT-C on indices of recruitment, randomization, attendance, medication adherence, participation, retention, homework completion, acceptance, and teacher fidelity. Aim 3 is to preliminarily evaluate (within group) pre-, post-, and follow-up measures of ADHD severity, behavior, attention, executive function, working memory, and mindfulness.In accordance with the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Medicine’s framework for developing mind and body interventions, data from this feasibility study will be used in subsequent mechanism- based, multi-site feasibility, and multi-site efficacy studies that will be funded by R61/R33, U01, UG3/UH3+U24 grants, respectively, as well as a K23 training grant. The ultimate goal is to develop a non-pharmacologic intervention for children with ADHD with the efficacy of pharmacotherapy, but without its side effects.',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"Project Summary/AbstractYouth living with HIV (YLHIV) are at the forefront of the HIV epidemic globally, as more perinatally infectedchildren increasingly survive into adulthood, and more youth become infected worldwide. HIV-related stigma isa critical challenge to antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and retention in care of YLHIV and is associatedwith mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. Few stigma-reduction strategies exist for youth,however, particularly in low and middle income countries (LMICs). The overall goals of the proposed researchare to deepen understanding of the spectrum of stigma experienced by YLHIV in Vietnam and to identify relevantmediation strategies. Our Specific Aims (SA) are to 1) adapt a psychosocial stigma-reduction intervention forYLHIV in Vietnam based on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) principles and delivered by telephone, usingcritical input from youth during intervention development; 2) assess the feasibility, acceptability and preliminaryefficacy of this innovative approach to reduce stigma, and improve psychosocial wellbeing and ART adherenceamong YLHIV through a small pre-post study; 3) explore the multiple facets of stigma experienced by YLHIV inVietnam and their relationships with ART adherence and psychosocial wellbeing via quantitative surveys andelectronic adherence monitoring; and 4) strengthen our team's capacity to conduct future research on stigmaand stigma-reduction interventions. The research will be conducted over two years in three phases. Phase 1 willcomprise intervention development including initial interviews with YLHIV and pilot testing to meet SA1. In Phase2, the intervention will be provided remotely to 40 YLHIV accessing HIV care at outpatient clinics in Hanoi;sociodemographic, psychosocial, and clinical data will be collected at baseline and endline, and adherence willbe monitored continuously via wireless pill containers. Phase 3 will involve data analysis and disseminationactivities. Our proposed intervention will target multiple levels of stigma experienced by YLHIV using supportiveself-management skills; it is grounded in CBT principles and in previous research which has documentedinterrelationships among stigma, psychosocial wellbeing, and ART adherence. The core psychosocial treatmentplan will comprise four months of weekly coaching sessions by phone, followed by two monthly “booster”sessions, and will be tailored to the situation of each participant. Analysis of baseline, endline, and the continuousadherence data will enable the achievement of SA2 and SA3 and thereby contribute to the scientific evidencebase on low-cost strategies to reduce stigma and improve psychosocial wellbeing and ART adherence for YLHIVin LMICs. The study's team of experienced multi-disciplinary Vietnamese and American researchers hasexceptional capacity to conduct the study; our close collaboration supplemented by skill-specific trainingthroughout the project will help us to strengthen our capacity to conduct future work on stigma and psychosocialinterventions, thus addressing SA4. With strong support from Vietnamese officials and clinicians, as well asinternational experts, our results have high potential for policy and program impact.\",\n",

       "   'abstract': \"Access to effective palliative care is a critical public health priority in Tanzania and Africa as a whole, with arecognized need for innovative community-based solutions to a limited palliative care workforce. Mobiletechnology promises to improve this access for Tanzanian cancer patients; significantly, the feasibility, usabilityand effectiveness of such applications need to be determined. We hypothesize that a mobile device-basedsymptom assessment, control and communication application (m-Palliative Care Link (mPCL)) willextend access to palliative care specialists (“specialists”), resulting in symptom control information exchangebetween specialists, patients, and local health workers, and reduced symptom burden in late-stage cancerpatients. mPCL is based on an existing, locally validated, Palliative care Outcome Scale (POS), adaptedthrough this work for mobile delivery. Specific aims are:Aim 1. Design and create a secure mobile communication application (m-Palliative Care Link (mPCL))to facilitate remote assessment of and communication about patient symptom control needs amongspecialists, patients/caregivers, and local health workers (user groups). mPCL will: a) enablegeneration/update of a patient's record by the specialist for ongoing review by the specialist and local healthworker; b) deliver POS to the patient/caregiver to complete and return on a secure network via mobile device;c) allow the specialist to communicate with the patient/caregiver and local health worker regarding symptomassessment and control based on existing standards and patient desires; d) track symptom control as atrajectory throughout the patient's illness via collection, storage, and analysis of POS responses.Aim 2. Usability test an mPCL prototype by a combination of hands-on observation/feedback and survey-based assessment of ease of use and suggestions for change among 5-7 participants from each user group.Data will be used to improve mPCL design for subsequent field test (Aim 3).Aim 3. Field test and validate usability of mPCL among 45 late-stage cancer patients to: a) determine thefeasibility, acceptability, barriers, and facilitators of using mPCL for communication and action regardingsymptom assessment, information exchange, and symptom control; b) further optimize mPCL for a futureeffectiveness trial; c) determine per patient cost of mPCL implementation; d) gather data on symptom controlneeds of Tanzanian cancer patients.Aim 4. Collect preliminary data comparing field test symptom outcomes with 45 usual care patients.Usual care patients will be recruited to complete the POS at each outpatient palliative care clinic visit. Bycomparing usual care symptom-based outcomes and medication type, dose and duration with those of fieldtest patients, we will collect preliminary data on mPCL impact, critical to design of a future large-scale mPCLoutcomes study. This work promises to be sustainable and scalable.\",\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Project Summary/AbstractAn unacceptably high percentage of our nation’s low-income, minority youth (< 18 years of age) are notregularly physically active. This contributes to extreme health disparities such as obesity rates nearly two-foldhigher than those seen in white youth and greater risk for diabetes and related cardiometabolic disorders. Thepresence of quality youth physical activity opportunities (YPAO) enables and encourages physically activelifestyles. Unfortunately, quality YPAOs often are lacking in places where minority youth live, resulting in lowactivity levels and subsequent health issues that represent significant disparities in our society. Our previousresearch found that small businesses (< 500 employees), which represent over 99% of all employers, arepowerful resources for creating and improving YPAOs. In accordance with the Socioecological Model andestablished philanthropic principles, we developed an alpha version of an intervention (alpha-i) for increasingsmall businesses’ involvement with YPAOs. We are now poised to create a beta version (beta-i) and conduct apilot study of its impact on small business support for YPAOs and YPAO utilization by youth in low-income,minority neighborhoods. To meet this objective, we will complete the following specific aims. Aim 1: Refinealpha-i components by completing focus groups with small business owners, YPAO providers, andparents/guardians of youth from low-income, predominantly minority neighborhoods. Results of the qualitativeanalysis will inform final tailoring of the intervention to create the beta-i which will be tested in Aim 2. Aim 2:Determine the effect of the beta-i on small business support for YPAOs in low-income, minority neighborhoodsby conducting a plot cluster randomized-control trial with randomization at the neighborhood level. Interventionneighborhoods (n=10) will receive the beta-i while control neighborhoods (n=10) will be provided a standardpractice intervention for a period of one year. The primary outcome for aim 2 will be the percentage of smallbusinesses not supporting YPAOs at baseline that subsequently provide support for YPAOs at follow-up. Wealso will consider the U.S. dollar equivalent of all types of support (monetary, goods/services and time) donatedfor YPAOs by small businesses. Aim 3: Examine the impact of the increased small business support for YPAOson YPAO utilization by youth. The primary outcome will be the percent change in the number of youthparticipating in YPAOs from baseline and follow-up in the treatment and control neighborhoods. The proposedstudy is significant because it will provide evidence that an easily replicated approach can be used to increasesmall business support for YPAOs and that this support results in greater use of the YPAOs by youth. Our nextstep will be to determine if YPAO changes resulting from increased small business support positively influenceyouth physical activity levels as measured by accelerometry. Our long-term goals are to create a nationallyimplementable practice for increasing support for YPAOs and strengthen the science of addressing healthdisparities in socially disadvantaged populations.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Project Summary/Abstract Sudden-onset injuries—such as acquired injuries or insults to the brain, spinal cord, and majorextremities—begin in an instant and typically cannot be reversed. While there is potential for varying degreesof physical, functional, psychosocial, and/or cognitive recovery with rehabilitation, these injuries often result inlife-long and life-altering disabilities. Furthermore, many such injuries occur in individuals who are young,active, and otherwise healthy. With the approximately 2.58 million new injuries to the brain, spine, or limb thatoccur each year, and an estimated 14.45 million individuals living in the U.S. with long-term disabilities relatedto these conditions, sudden-onset injuries are some of the most common causes of morbidity in the U.S. Giventhe invaluable opportunity to improve outcomes for such a large number of individuals, there is a vital need tobetter understand the complex patterns of symptoms experienced by these individuals in the long term toinform high-quality clinical care. Symptom clustering science offers an ideal method to achieve this goal. This project’s broad, long-term objective is to understand the complex patterns of symptoms displayed afteracquired injuries to the brain, spine, or limb, so that clinical care can be improved. Symptom clustering hasproven useful as a strategy for personalized medicine with complex medical conditions, such as cancer.However, there are several significant gaps in the literature, including the need to expand these methods toother clinical groups, define the characteristics of symptom clusters, identify instruments and metrics formeasuring symptom clusters, and apply novel analytic strategies for detecting symptom clusters. This work will leverage over a decade of the investigators’ prior qualitative and quantitative work on severallarge, multi-site studies with these clinical populations. In particular, existing data sets will be reanalyzed usingnew symptom clustering techniques. Results from these new analyses will be used to identify and characterizethe most important symptom clusters for individuals with acquired disabilities. Then, a new, more diversesample of individuals with acquired injuries to the brain, spine, or limb will be collected and evaluated toexamine the generalizability and stability of these symptom clusters for use within and across rehabilitationpopulations. Last, the findings will be used to generate guidelines and clinical tools to translate symptomclusters into clinical practice. This work will be accomplished through four aims. Aim 1: Identify transdiagnostic and condition-specificsymptom clusters present in individuals with traumatic injuries. Aim 2: Explore the generalizability andreproducibility of the symptom clusters identified in Aim 1 in a diverse sample of individuals with acquireddisabilities. Aim 3: Examine longitudinally the stability and predictive utility of symptom clusters in a diversesample of individuals with acquired disabilities. Aim 4: Develop guidelines and clinical tools for assessing andinterpreting symptom clusters in individuals with acquired disabilities.',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Data collected from intensive care units could be used to guide decision-making in real-time, but instead have often led to overwhelmed clinicians trying to uncover the signal buried in the noise. This data deluge is particularly challenging whenthe data are delayed, as this can lead to events being incorrectly seen as simultaneous or even out of order. Patients' health also changes at different time scales such as due to a new medication or circadian rhythms. Thus as doctors attempt to integrate the many signals to understand a patient's status, their health is a moving target. To transform the data into actionable knowledge, it is also not enough to find correlations. We must be sure that the patterns we find are truly causal to avoid treating symptoms instead of a disease or launching unsuccessful clinical trials. Our prior work, though, has found that ICU data streams can in fact be used to gain insight into recovery from stroke. In particular, we revealed that nonconvulsive seizures may be related to poor outcomes in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Unlike epileptic seizures, which have a sudden onset, these seizures begin gradually, making them difficult to detect automatically. Further, many SAH patients in our study were unconscious on admission, and it is difficult to frequently and reliably assess consciousness. Therefore while progress has been made, two key barriers to using ICU data to guide treatment are a) a lack of methods for finding gradual changes in a patient's state (which could be used to alert clinicians) and b) finding causal relationships with uncertain data (where the cause may be documented as happening after the effect). To address these challenges, our specific aims are 1) to develop methods for finding timing uncertainty for each variable and using this in causal inference, 2) to develop real-time methods for finding when things change, and 3) to apply these to find when stroke patients have seizures or changes in consciousness, so these can be quickly identified and treated. We propose that by learning the reasons for errors in data, and by developing methods that specifically model their uncertain and changing nature, we will enable better use of large-scale observational biomedical data for real-time treatment decisions.\",\n",

       "   'abstract': \"Enormous amounts of biomedical data are generated by hospitals, but most of this data is available onlyafter people become ill. For people with chronic diseases such as diabetes, though, many important eventshappen outside of the medical system. Patient generated health data (PGHD) can provide detailed insightinto an individual's health during daily life. With longterm continuous glucose data, activity data, and foodlogs, we could develop personalized models of how factors affect blood glucose and deliver personalizedguidance to patients on how to better manage it. Transforming PGHD into information to guide decisions isa highly general problem that applies to all forms of diabetes, and other chronic diseases. We specificallyfocus on identifying dietary and lifestyle risk factors for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). GDM occurs in9% of pregnancies, and leads to a 7-fold increase in Type 2 Diabetes risk after birth, making it a significantpublic health problem. Pregnancy provides an ideal test bed for methods designed to make use of PGHDand uncover causes, as outcomes can be captured in a limited study duration. Motivated by trying to findcauses and effects of nutrition in pregnancy, we develop generalizable algorithms that address widespreadchallenges in the use of PGHD for causal inference. First, existing causal inference methods assume wehave well-defined variables (e.g. bodyweight), but nutrition can be measured in many ways (calories,macronutrients, food groups). This puts a large burden on users, and limits the potential for data-driveninference. We introduce the first causal inference algorithm that automatically identifies optimal variablegranularity for each relationship, by leveraging ontologies. This allows identification of different effectsbetween, say, protein and specific meats on health outcomes, without users needing to specify suchhypotheses. Second, while individual level data is essential for personalized inference, only limited datamay be available when a treatment decision must be made or when health status is changing over time,such as during pregnancy. Leveraging population data can yield more accurate inferences, but existingmethods are unable to identify relevant data dynamically and pregnant individuals may be more similar toothers at the same stage of pregnancy than to themselves in the recent past. We introduce new methodsfor dynamic causal transfer learning that continually identify and adapt relevant population data forpersonalized causal inference. We initially test our approach on publicly available ICU, diabetes, andnutrition datasets, before collecting a unique dietary and activity dataset from 150 pregnant individuals.RELEVANCE (Sae instructions):Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a significant public health problem, and while changes in diet duringpregnancy may increase risk, it is currently unknown which dietary factors have the most influence. Thisproject develops better methods for continually assessing GDM risk and gaining insight into diet in alongterm individualized way. The methods developed will be generalizable to other types of health data andmay in particular yield insights into causes and effects of diabetes and chronic disease.\",\n",

       "   'abstract': 'African Americans suffer from a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality from a wide spectrum ofconditions, such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease and cancer, and these disparities are not attributablesolely to individual socioeconomic status or access to health care. Research has shown that socialdeterminants are key factors in African American health and health disparities. Evidence is mounting for thehealth impact of neighborhood context, particularly with regard to the food environment. Several studies havedocumented that African American communities are disproportionately exposed to fast food, and other studieshave shown that exposure to fast food is associated with greater risk of obesity and other chronic disease.What have been little studied are the complex historical drivers of racially patterned exposure to fast food.Research is needed to interrogate the forces that moved fast food from its historical origins of middle-classWhite suburban and rural communities to the predominantly Black central city. The proposed study seeks toadvance research on social determinants of health by conducting historical analyses of the racialtransformation of fast food in the U.S. from 1955 to 1995, focusing on large cities with large Black populationsin the Midwest and Northeast. Drawing on archival resources from a number of collections, I will produce abook that will be of interest to scholars in public health, the social sciences and the humanities. In so doing,the proposed work will make an innovative contribution to understanding what puts African Americans at risk ofhealth risks.',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"Project SummaryThis proposal requests funds for the upgrade of an existing 600 MHz NMR spectrometer with amodern console and a helium-cooled cryogenic quadnuclear (1H, 13C, 15N, 31P) probe. Theproposed upgrade will utilize the existing ultra-shielded magnet while replacing the spectrometerconsole and probes that are 18 years old, malfunctioning, and no longer supported by themanufacturer. While this instrument was once highly utilized, the failure of the originalcryoprobe, and the outdated hardware and software of this instrument, have severely limited itsfunctionality. The proposed upgrade will recapture critical capabilities that were lost to manyresearch groups when the old cryoprobe failed irreparably. The upgrade will also add newcapabilities that were not available. This includes analysis of the many limited quantity samplesof complex molecules that are common to many different research groups. The enhancedsensitivity of the instrumentation will greatly improve productivity across a large user group.This new spectrometer will upgrade the existing 1H-detection triple-resonance (HCN) capability,in terms of detection sensitivity by 650%, for structural characterization of biomolecular proteinand peptides. New capabilities of the proposed instrument include optimized 13C and 31Pdetection with proton decoupling for low concentration and unstable samples. Correlationbetween 13C and 31P, which is critical to organometallic and structural biology applications, willbe enabled by the proposed spectrometer. Besides new capabilities introduced, a proposedauto-sampler coupled with a new biomolecular NMR automation package will allow a broadgroup of users to acquire high quality NMR data using this instrument.The proposed instrument will provide benefit to a large user base of NIH supported researchersthat spans the areas of organic chemistry, organometallic chemistry, biochemistry, biomaterials,chemical biology, and glycoscience. Projects to be facilitated by this grant will have impact onthe nation's health interests in drug discovery, radiochemical imaging, cancer therapy, tissueregeneration and drug delivery. Descriptions of research projects by ten major users and fiveminor users of the proposed instrumentation are described. The majority of users areinvestigators on currently funded NIH supported research projects. This instrumentation will alsoprovide substantive support to several major NIH initiatives centered at the University ofDelaware, including a Chemistry Biology Interface (NIH-CBI) Program, two Centers ofBiomedical Research Excellence (NIH-COBRE), the Delaware IDeA Network of BiomedicalResearch Excellence (NIH-INBRE), and a Center for Translational Research (NIH-CTR).!\",\n",

       "   'abstract': 'With this Phase 2 submission, IsoPlexis proposes to deliver a single-cell proteomic solution for ultra-sensitivedetection of unique correlative biomarkers in pre-clinical mouse models, in an automated system that can beused to accelerate the discovery of potential immune therapeutics. The recent revolution in new basic sciencediscovery is failing to translate into improved patient treatment. The reduction of new drug and biologicapplications submitted to the FDA every year is directly due to only 10% of promising preclinically approvedtreatments eventually advancing to market. As the pharmaceutical/biotech industry embarks on capitalizing onnew immunotherapy discoveries, the complex human immune system presents challenges to the developmentof new treatments. While improved humanized mouse models (such as the Humanized Immune Systems, HIS)are a step forward, a need exists for an enabling biomedical technology to improve immune biomarker detectionthat de-risks therapy selection translating to success in human treatment. A platform which (1) measuressecreted protein polyfunctionality in a single-cell platform for mice, and (2) gathers this data from limited mousesamples is necessary. (3) The technology should be able to measure multiplexed, emerging, protein biomarkersthat have proven critical to such immune therapies in humans, drastically improving clinical success. With thesuccesses from the Phase I part of the project, IsoPlexis has developed such a high-resolution immune responsebiomarker detection system (SCBC), delivering a comprehensive evaluation of the full polyfunctional proteinsecretion response of each immune cell to treatment, an analysis that has proven valuable in otherimmunotherapy arenas. This approach will maximize the potential data obtained from HIS mouse preclinicalstudies to advance the very best treatments. The two-year project will accomplish the following: Aim 1 Developan integrated “flow cell” consumable cartridge, with a >28-plex single-cell protein panel to evaluate human T cellresponse in HIS (humanized) mice and other genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs). Aim 2: Developan automated system to enable the handling of limited murine sample size and increase assay throughput, forlarger-scale mouse screening studies in pre-clinical laboratories. Aims 3: Demonstrate proof-of-concept utilityof this technology across four trials, for profiling polyfunctional response in HIS mice and other GEMMs,advancing biomarkers that lead to success in human treatments.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The goal of this proposal is to obtain a state-of-the-art ZetaView TWIN Laser Nanoparticle Tracking Analyzer(NTA) device at the University of Vermont (UVM). There is no comparable instrument on campus or at regionalinstitutions, and it would meet the increasing demand and interest in a breadth of NTA research applicationsacross campus. Further, as Vermont is an IDeA/EPSCRoR state, this device will be a further valuable resourceto be shared through the IDeA/EPSCoR network.The requested device will enhance current research, and will be particularly essential for future cutting-edgenanoparticle research for the UVM Larner College of Medicine (LCOM) community. The instrument will beintegrated into the LCOM Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting Core Facility, ensuring access to researchersthroughout the University. The rationale for a new instrument is to better enable a diverse and growing range ofnanoparticle studies involving both biologic and non-biologic samples. The proposed TWIN laser NTA device,manufactured by Particle Metrix Inc., has been carefully vetted and chosen after extensive discussions with themanufacturer, as well as recent demos of competing NTA devices on the UVM campus.Seven investigators have been identified as Major Users for the purpose of this application, as they representmost of the projected demand for the requested instrument given their existing and proposed researchapplications and requirements. We have also identified a large and strong group of 18 minor users that willaccount for the remaining time on the proposed new system. Notably, between the major and minor users, atotal of 21 users have NIH funding, accounting for 95% of the total accessible user time. The Major User andMinor User groups assembled for this proposal represent faculty and biomedical research interests in the UVMLarner College of Medicine from the Departments of Biochemistry, Medicine, Microbiology & MolecularGenetics, Molecular Physiology & Biophysics, Neuroscience, Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, andPharmacology. Moreover, these faculty also represent the Vermont Cancer Center, the CardiovascularResearch Institute, the Vermont Lung Center, the Vermont Center for Immunology and Infectious Diseases,and the Cellular, Molecular, and Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program. Further strong interest and use willcome from the UVM Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Engineering and Mathematical Sciences, and Nursing andHealth Sciences. We further anticipate growing use from investigators at regional institutions. Thus, theaddition of a ZetaView TWIN Laser NTA device will be a powerful tool to further the capacity for advanced high-quality investigations and ensure sustained and efficient use for the UVM biomedical research community forthe future.',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"This proposal requests the purchase of a LUMICKS C-Trap instrument for a Major User group at the Universityof Vermont (an IDeA state institution). The C-Trap is the only commercially available laser trap with combinedscanning confocal fluorescence microscopy. Mechanobiology is an emerging field concerning physical forcesand their impact on biological functions. In cells, tiny molecular motors interact with tracks to generate forceand motion involved in biological movement critical to muscle contraction, intracellular cargo transport (such asinsulin granules), and DNA repair. Therefore, investigators utilize biophysical approaches to correlate thestructural dynamics (nm motions in ms timescales) and mechanics (pN forces) of individual molecular motorsand protein machines as they undergo critical protein-protein interactions with their tracks while performingtheir normal physiological functions. The LUMICKS C-Trap would provide University of Vermont investigatorsthe capability to make such measurements at the single molecule level. Although a custom-built laser trapexists at the university, it's 21 years old with simple epifluorescence; preventing investigators from performingtrue molecular structure and functional studies described above. More importantly, the existing laser trap isbuilt with components no longer supported or manufactured; placing users at risk of a total system failure. The requested LUMICKS C-Trap with its real-time correlative, laser trapping and scanning confocalfluorescence microscopy, is a turn-key system with a multi-channel microfluidic experimental chamber. Thischamber makes setup of single molecule protein-protein interaction assays relatively simple. Couple this easewith the C-Trap's user friendly software control and data collection/analysis package, investigators productivityshould be greatly enhanced. In addition, the mechanistic insights governing the processes that the molecularmachines studied undergo will become apparent given the unprecedented resolution of molecular structureand function made possible with the LUMICKS C-Trap. Four Major Users have been identified for the purpose of this application as they represent most of theprojected demand (i.e. 80%) for the requested instrument, given their existing and proposed experimentalrequirements. We also identified a strong Minor User group that will use the remaining time on the proposedsystem. These two University of Vermont User groups represent faculty and biomedical research interests fromthe Departments of Molecular Physiology & Biophysics, Pharmacology, and Microbiology & MolecularGenetics. These faculty also represent the Cardiovascular Research Institute, Vermont Cancer Center, and theCellular, Molecular, and Biomedical Sciences and Biomedical Engineering Graduate Programs. The LUMICKSC-Trap with its management through the College of Medicine's Microscopy Imaging Center will afford thecapacity for advanced single molecule mechanical recording and structural imaging and ensure sustained andefficient use for the university's biomedical research community for the foreseeable future.\",\n",

Purchased over 16 years ago, our current LSRII flowcytometer is the only instrument present at the University of Vermont that can detect more than 8optical parameters at a time. Therefore, this single instrument serves the needs of 25 NIH-supported investigators, and 27 NIH grants, at the University of Vermont who conduct high-endflow cytometric data acquisition for their research. Our 16-year old LSRII is near the end of itsservice life. In recent years, down-time due to increased need for maintenance and repair hassteadily increased. The LSRII was last manufactured in 2009, and the manufacturer will ceasesupporting the instrument in the next year, increasing the likelihood that replacement parts will beharder to procure. The new Aurora flow cytometer that will replace our LSRII will be located in theLarner College of Medicine Flow Cytometry Facility, which has been in existence for over 25years, and which serves a broad community of investigators from a variety of disciplines. Thisfacility is managed by an experienced and accredited scientist/cytometrist, is directed by a facultyadvisor with over 20 years of experience in flow cytometry and immunology, is overseen by aninternal advisory committee, and continues to enjoy strong institutional support from the RobertLarner, M.D. College of Medicine.

       "   'abstract': 'AbstractSignificance: Infantile Pompe Disease (IPD) is an autosomal recessive glycogen storage disorder causedby a deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), leading to accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes,primarily in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles. Untreated IPD infants die within the first 2 years of life.Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) improves survival and qualityof life, but the development of sustained anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATA) potentially reduces ERTefficacy. All IPD patients who have no GAA protein expression (circulating cross-reactive immunologicmaterial [CRIM]-negative) are predicted to mount high titer ATA, and are treated with an intensive ImmuneTolerance Induction (ITI) regimen. While some CRIM-positive IPD patients become tolerized to ERT overtime, over one-third of CRIM-positive patients still develop treatment-limiting ATA. There is currently noeffective method for determining which CRIM-positive patients are at risk of developing treatment-limitingATA, and would therefore benefit from treatment with an ITI regimen. This project will validate a recentlydeveloped algorithm, GAA-iTEM, for predicting the risk of ATA development for individual IPDpatients, in a retrospective study of clinical data and in vitro studies of GAA T cell epitopes.Hypothesis: CRIM-positive IPD patients are tolerized to their own residual native GAA (nGAA) but maydevelop ATA to ERT with rhGAA. Using well-established computational tools to identify T cell epitopes inrhGAA which are predicted to stimulate CD4 T cells (and thus promote a T dependent B cell response torhGAA), patients may be classified as high or low risk for the development of ATA. T cell epitopes that arecross-conserved between nGAA and rhGAA (and other endogenous epitopes) are unlikely to induce a Tcell response. GAA-iTEM currently predicts ATA risk, using the patient’s HLA type and nGAA sequence.We propose to improve GAA-iTEM using newly accessible clinical data and samples. In Specific Aim 1,40 CRIM+ IPD patients followed at Duke with defined ATA responses will be evaluated using GAA-iTEMto generate a patient-specific GAA-Individualized T cell Epitope Measure (GAA-iTEM) score. Clinical andgenetic factors will be used to refine the predictive tool, which will be made available through a prototypegraphical user interface to Duke clinicians, who will assess patient-specific risk and deposit clinical datafor future calibration of the prediction algorithm. In Specific Aim 2, GAA CD4 T cell effector and regulatoryepitopes identified in silico will be evaluated for HLA binding, cytokine stimulation, and generation of Tregs.Overall Impact: GAA-iTEM will provide researchers with an individualized assessment of a patient’s riskfor developing treatment-limiting ATA based on their HLA haplotype and nGAA mutations, improvingdecision-making regarding ITI treatment. Once validated, the new GAA-iTEM would be used to assessATA risk in a prospective study, and to develop ATA-risk assessment tools for related genetic disorders.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTThis proposal seeks funding to support the 2019 Nucleosides, Nucleotides and Oligonucleotides (NNO) GordonResearch Conference and associated Gordon Research Seminar. This will be the 20th edition of this conference,which was initiated in 1976. Throughout its history, this conference has addressed topics that are directly relatedto the fundamental science of human biology and the treatment of disease. Nucleosides and nucleotides havebeen extremely effective drugs, most notably antivirals such as AZT and Harvoni, for the treatment of HIV/AIDSand hepatitis C, respectively. Meanwhile, the field has broadened to include oligonucleotides as biomedicalresearch tools and, increasingly, therapeutics for genetic diseases, such as Spinraza, which treats spinalmuscular atrophy. Our Gordon Conference has evolved along with the field, with its original focus on smallmolecules expanding to include oligomers in 2005.The 2019 edition of the conference will include sessions dedicated to (1) new advances in antivirals, (2) uses ofmodified nucleotides in oligomers, (3) small molecule recognition of DNA and RNA, (4) nucleic acids chemicalbiology and (5) oligonucleotide therapeutics. (Additional sessions will be organized after final invitations havebeen accepted and speakers have submitted their titles.) The PI solicited nominations from experts in the field,emphasizing the desire to identify members of under-represented groups and young scientists as potentialspeakers. (Of the 21 invited speakers, 9 are women, including one African-American; the average GRC has 30%female speakers.) The affiliated Gordon Research Seminar will feature oral presentations by students andpostdocs, a panel discussion with established scientists in the field, and the opportunity to create a sense ofcommunity prior to the start of the GRC. In addition, the GRC “Power Hour” will take place during one afternoonand provides a forum in which all participants can discuss the unique challenges faced by women in science.Thus, while the cutting edge science described during the oral sessions will undoubtedly inspire others to movetheir own research forward in new and creative ways, the GRS, Power Hour and other efforts to support women,minorities and young scientists in general will strengthen the field and its impact on human health for decadesto come.',\n",
